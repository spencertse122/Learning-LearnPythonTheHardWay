# Learn Python The Hardway

## Introduction
This is the first complete Python training book I have completed. The entire repository followed along the book's exercises, with some modifications to accomodate the latest version of Python.(e.g. using PyTest module for testing instead of nose)

## Review
As a data analyst with mostly Pandas and SQL background, this is a good taste of the real "Programming World". It allowed me to explore the terminal world, how to properly structure my code into an object-oriented fashion.
